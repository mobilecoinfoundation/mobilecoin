mc-util-keyfile
========

As part of the demo infrastructure, we need to write out little binary
files which represent user root secrets. These files are generated by bootstrap
and consumed by other binary targets when they are deployed.

This crate contains a common interface to write and read these files, and a tool
to inspect these files.
