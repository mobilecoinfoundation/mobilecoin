Helpers for creating and verifying [Bulletproofs](https://doc-internal.dalek.rs/bulletproofs/index.html).

"Bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require no trusted setup. A bulletproof can be used to convince a verifier that an encrypted plaintext is well formed. For example, prove that an encrypted number is in a given range, without revealing anything else about the number."
