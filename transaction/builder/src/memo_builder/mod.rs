/// The MemoBuilder trait defines the API that the transaction builder uses
/// to ask the memo builder to build a memo for a particular TxOut.
///
/// The intention is that the memo builder represents a policy for the entire
/// transaction, and it is constructed and configured first. Then, it is
/// installed in the transaction builder when that is constructed.
/// This way low-level handing of memo payloads with TxOuts is not needed,
/// and just invoking the TransactionBuilder as before will do the right thing.
///
/// Note: Even if the memo builder creates memo paylaods, they will be filtered
/// out by the transaction builder if the block version is too low for memos
/// to be supported.
