description = '''
This crate defines a schema for storing a set of trusted measurements for one of several
enclaves in json. Then, a helper function can produce an `mc-attest-verifier::Verifier`
which is appropriate for a given enclave.

This is meant to help clients that connect to several mobilecoin enclaves to configure their verifiers
appropriately.
