//! Logic for representing fog public keys from the fog-report server
//! that have been fully validated, and the associated metadata.
//!
//! Note: Ideally this crate would be no_std compatible, but that is
//! aspirational. The ReportResponse object is not no_std right now, and neither
//! is x509 stuff. This is tracked in FOG-334.
//! The main reason to make it no_std compatible is to support constructing
//! mobilecoin transactions with fog recipients on an embedded device like a
//! tiny hardware wallet, that doesn't have threads and won't have rust std.
