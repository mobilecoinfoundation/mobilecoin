//! Logic for representing fog public keys from the fog-report server
//! that have been fully validated, and the associated metadata.
//!
//! Note: Ideally this crate would be no_std compatible, but that is aspirational.
//! The ReportResponse object is not no_std right now, and neither is x509 stuff.
//! This is tracked in FOG-334.
//! The main reason to make it no_std compatible is to support constructing
//! mobilecoin transactions with fog recipients on an embedded device like a
//! tiny hardware wallet, that doesn't have threads and won't have rust std.

/// Represents a set of unvalidated responses from Fog report servers
/// Key = Fog-url that was contacted, must match the string in user's public address
/// Value = The complete response from the fog report server
///
/// When constructing a transaction, the fog-url for each recipient should be
/// extracted from their public address, then a request to that report server should
/// be made. The responses should be collected in a map-structure (like this).
/// This should be done for each recipient.
///
/// This map structure is ultimately consumed by the TransactionBuilder object,
/// which validates the responses against the fog data in the public addresses when
/// building the transaction.
///
/// This map structure should not be cached, because the fog pubkeys have an
/// expiry date and don't live that long. They can be cached for a short time,
/// but the transaction builder enforces that the tombstone block for the transaction
/// is limited by the pubkey expiry value of any fog pubkey that is used,
/// so if these are cached too long, the transaction will be rejected by consensus.
///
/// In the case of constructing off-line transactions with Fog recipients, the flow is:
/// (1) Take fog-urls from (offline) public addresses to the online machine
/// (2) Hit the fog report servers (online machine), producing FogReportResponses
/// (3) Take FogReportResponses to the offline machine, and use with transaction builder,
///     to create the transaction offline.
/// (4) Take the constructed transaction to the online machine and submit to consensus.
///
/// Note: there is no particular reason for this to be BTreeMap instead of HashMap,
/// except that it is slightly more portable, only requiring the alloc crate.

/// A collection of unvalidated fog reports, together with an IAS verifier.
/// This object is passed to the TransactionBuilder object.
/// When fog is not involved, it can simply be defaulted.
///
/// Once constructed, this object can get validated fog pubkeys to build fog hints
/// for transactions, without talking to the internet, and so is compatible with
/// offline transactions to fog recipients. Only getting the FogReportResponses
/// requires an online connection.
