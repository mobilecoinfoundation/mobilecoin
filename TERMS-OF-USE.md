# **TERMS OF USE**  **FOR MOBILECOINS AND MOBILECOIN WALLETS**

The MobileCoin Network uses an open source software protocol commonly known as the MobileCoin protocol. The MobileCoin protocol is designed to enable holders of digital tokens known as MobileCoins to send and receive peer-to-peer payments securely and privately through a digital wallet that can send and receive MobileCoins (MobileCoin Wallets). MobileCoins and MobileCoin Wallets enable a simple, secure, and private medium of exchange for consumers in countries of operation to manage and move their money using a currency of equivalent value across countries.

These Terms of Use for MobileCoins and MobileCoin Wallets (Terms) govern:

- MobileCoins and their use and transfer; and
- MobileCoin Wallets and their access and use.

Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use any MobileCoins and any MobileCoin Wallet. By acquiring or otherwise obtaining MobileCoins, using or transferring MobileCoins or obtaining, accessing or using a MobileCoin Wallet, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and completely agree to be bound by these Terms. You also agree to require any transferee of your MobileCoins and any holder of a MobileCoin Wallet facilitated by you to be subject to these Terms. These Terms may be enforced against you by MobileCoin TS Ltd., MobileCoin U.S., LLC or other authorized entities (which are collectively referred to in these Terms as the Compliance Entities). These Terms may be amended, changed, or updated by the Compliance Entities at any time and without prior notice to you by posting at [www.buymobilecoin.us]. Your continued use of any MobileCoins and any MobileCoin Wallets following the posting of any amendment, change, or update means that you accept and agree to the amended, changed, or updated Terms. These Terms are first effective as of [August \_\_], 2021 and supersede any previous versions.

Access or use of any MobileCoin Wallets or use or transfer of any MobileCoins is void where such access, use or transfer is prohibited by, would constitute a violation of, or would be subject to penalties under applicable laws. Such access or use of MobileCoin Wallets or use or transfer of any MobileCoins which is void will not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest, right, remedy, power, or privilege.
