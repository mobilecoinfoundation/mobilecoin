# **TERMS OF USE**  **FOR MOBILECOINS AND MOBILECOIN WALLETS**

The MobileCoin Network uses an open source software protocol commonly known as the MobileCoin protocol. The MobileCoin protocol is designed to enable holders of digital tokens known as MobileCoins to send and receive peer-to-peer payments securely and privately through a digital wallet that can send and receive MobileCoins (MobileCoin Wallets). MobileCoins and MobileCoin Wallets enable a simple, secure, and private medium of exchange for consumers in countries of operation to manage and move their money using a currency of equivalent value across countries.

These Terms of Use for MobileCoins and MobileCoin Wallets (Terms) govern:

- MobileCoins and their use and transfer; and
- MobileCoin Wallets and their access and use.

Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use any MobileCoins and any MobileCoin Wallet. By acquiring or otherwise obtaining MobileCoins, using or transferring MobileCoins or obtaining, accessing or using a MobileCoin Wallet, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and completely agree to be bound by these Terms. You also agree to require any transferee of your MobileCoins and any holder of a MobileCoin Wallet facilitated by you to be subject to these Terms. These Terms may be enforced against you by MobileCoin TS Ltd., MobileCoin U.S., LLC or other authorized entities (which are collectively referred to in these Terms as the Compliance Entities). These Terms may be amended, changed, or updated by the Compliance Entities at any time and without prior notice to you by posting at [www.buymobilecoin.us](https://www.buymobilecoin.us/). Your continued use of any MobileCoins and any MobileCoin Wallets following the posting of any amendment, change, or update means that you accept and agree to the amended, changed, or updated Terms. These Terms are first effective as of August 17, 2021 and supersede any previous versions.

Access or use of any MobileCoin Wallets or use or transfer of any MobileCoins is void where such access, use or transfer is prohibited by, would constitute a violation of, or would be subject to penalties under applicable laws. Such access or use of MobileCoin Wallets or use or transfer of any MobileCoins which is void will not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest, right, remedy, power, or privilege. \[Please also consult the applicable Terms of Sale and Access and Use of the Site, available at the MobileCoin U.S. LLC website at [www.buymobilecoin.us](https://www.buymobilecoin.us/) or the MobileCoin TS Ltd. website at [www.buymobilecoin.com](https://www.buymobilecoin.com).

## **MobileCoin Wallets**

No MobileCoin Wallet may be operated for and no order or transaction in a MobileCoin Wallet may be used for the financial or other benefit of or on behalf of a Prohibited Person. Persons, whether or not Prohibited Persons, are prohibited from operating a MobileCoin Wallet in any way or otherwise transacting on or using any MobileCoins and any MobileCoin Wallets while they or any individual (including any fiduciary, dealer, trustee, executor or administrator), agency or branch operating their MobileCoin Wallet on their behalf is present in any jurisdiction in which MobileCoins are unlawful.

Certain software comprising MobileCoin Wallets is available to the public without charge on an open source basis. This software is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranty of any kind. However, MobileCoin Wallets linked to a mobile messaging application may integrate software from a third party. MobileCoin Wallets must be accessed through a telephone, computer or other equipment as well as a network connection through telecommunication lines or other utility. None of these components of the MobileCoin Wallet is provided or controlled by the Compliance Entities. The Compliance Entities are not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any open-source software or of any software, hardware, information, or advice provided by third parties or for their privacy and security policies and procedures.

Access to and use of your MobileCoin Wallet may from time to time be unavailable, delayed, limited or slowed due to failures of hardware, software, utility services or other causes outside the control of the Compliance Entities. You may suffer losses as a result of these delays and limitations. You assume all risks associated with the operation, performance and security of a MobileCoin Wallet. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your MobileCoin Wallet and any password or other security designed to limit access.

In addition to these Terms, you may be bound by any additional terms required by your third-party providers. These third parties&#39; terms may apply to your use of the MobileCoin Wallets. Please be aware that these Terms do not govern third parties&#39; relationships with you. These third parties, and not any Compliance Entity, are responsible for any product or service warranties, whether express or implied by law, provided to you.

MobileCoins are distributed and offered on an as-is, and, are offered without any representation as to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose.

You accept that the Compliance Entities may be required to share your user information with other contractual third parties, including financial institutions, or as required under applicable laws or demanded upon a lawful request by any government.
