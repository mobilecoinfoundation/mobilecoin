This crate provides no-std access to the FFI types provided by the Intel SGX SDK, particular those used as part of Intel's EPID-based remote attestation process. This crate is not intended to be used directly, but rather wrapped by a higher-level crate, `mcsgx-epid-types`, developers should use that crate and it's provided types for a more rusty experience.
