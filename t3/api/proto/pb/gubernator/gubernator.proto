  // latency in low throughput situations. For high volume loads, batching can reduce
  // the overall load on the system substantially.

  // Using this option gubernator will continue to use a single peer as the rate limit coordinator
  // to increment and manage the state of the rate limit, however the result of the rate limit is
  // distributed to each peer and cached locally. A rate limit request received from any peer in the
  // cluster will first check the local cache for a rate limit answer, if it exists the peer will
  // immediately return the answer to the client and asynchronously forward the aggregate hits to
  // the peer coordinator. Because of GLOBALS async nature we lose some accuracy in rate limit
  // reporting, which may result in allowing some requests beyond the chosen rate limit. However we
  // gain massive performance as every request coming into the system does not have to wait for a
  // single peer to decide if the rate limit has been reached.
