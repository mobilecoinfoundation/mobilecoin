/// The rust aead crate is organized around a Buffer trait which abstracts
/// commonalities of alloc::vec::Vec and heapless::Vec which are useful for
/// aead abstractions.
///
/// The needed functionalities are:
/// - Getting the bytes that have been written as a &mut [u8] (or &[u8])
/// - Extending the buffer (which is allowed to fail)
/// - Truncating the buffer
///
/// A drawback of heapless is that it is strictly an "owning" data-structure,
/// it doesn't have light-weight "views" or "reference" types.
///
/// This provides a zero-overhead abstraction over &mut [u8] which does this,
/// so that applications can easily use the aead trait to encrypt into e.g.
/// [u8; 128] without using vec, making allocations, or using heapless, which
/// might commit them to storing extra counters in their structures.
///
/// This represents a view of a fixed capacity buffer, where len() indicates
/// how many bytes, from the beginning of the buffer, have been "used".
///
/// It is expected that this type will be used to wrap e.g. [u8;128] briefly
/// in order to interact with interfaces like Aead, and then discarded.
