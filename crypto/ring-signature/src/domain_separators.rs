//! Domain separation tags for hash functions used in the MobileCoin amount and
//! MLSAG protocols.
//!
//! Domain separation allows multiple distinct hash functions to be derived from
//! a single base function:
//!   Hash_1(X) = Hash("Hash_1" || X),
//!   Hash_2(X) = Hash("Hash_2" || X),
//!   etc.
//!
//! Here, "Hash_1" and "Hash_2" are called domain separation tags. Tags should
//! uniquely identify the hash function within the protocol and may include the
//! protocol's version so that each derived hash function is independent of
//! others within the protocol and independent of hash functions in other
//! versions of the protocol.
