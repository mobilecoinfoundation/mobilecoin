description = '''
This crate provides a no-std compatible rng called `McRng`.

On targets with +rdrand target feature, it uses the intel RDRAND instruction
to get randomness directly from the CPU, bypassing a dependency on the OS, libc,
etc. For servers using SGX, this rng works in no_std trusted and untrusted code
equally well without changes, which is convenient.

For targets without rdrand, `McRng` is `ThreadRng`.
On wasm, `ThreadRng` is not available, so `McRng` is `OsRng`.

`McRng` is in all configurations a zero-width type.
