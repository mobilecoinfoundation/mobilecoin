description = '''
This crate provides a no-std compatible rng called `RdRandRng`.

On targets with +rdrand target feature, it uses the intel RDRAND instruction
to get randomness directly from the CPU, bypassing a dependency on the OS, libc,
etc. For servers using SGX, this rng works in trusted and untrusted code equally
well without changes, which is convenient.

For targets without rdrand, we provide a fallback implementation similar to the
standard rust `rand` crate's `thread_rng`, using the `getrandom` crate OsRng to
seed a thread-local rng. `RdRandRng` is in all configurations a zero-width type.
