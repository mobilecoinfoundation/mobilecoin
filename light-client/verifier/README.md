mc-light-client-verifier
========================

The mc-light-client-verifier crate contains code for a stateless validation routine
which can verify, based on static configuration, that a given block was externalized
by the network, given node signatures from the BlockMetadata for that Block.

For convenience, it can also verify that a TxOut was externalized as part of a given block.
