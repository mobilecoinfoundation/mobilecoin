## Pull Requests (PRs)

During TestNet, the MobileCoin team is actively developing in an internal repository, occasionally merging batches of PRs to the public repository. We are happy to review and consider PRs submitted against the public MobileCoin repository, but your changes will be taken as suggestions and may be rolled into a merge batch from the internal repository.
