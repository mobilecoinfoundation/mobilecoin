## Pull Requests (PRs)

During TestNet, the MobileCoin team is actively developing in an internal repo, occasionally merging batches of PRs to the public repository. We are happy to review and consider PRs submitted against the public MobileCoin repo, but your changes will be taken as suggestions and may be rolled into a merge batch from the internal repo.

Coming soon: Code Style Guidelines
