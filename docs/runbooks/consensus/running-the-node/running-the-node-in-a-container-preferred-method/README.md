### Entrypoint and Container Processes

Familiarize yourself with the [entrypoint for the consensus docker container](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/internal/blob/master/testnet-deploy/ops/entrypoints/consensus_validator.sh).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It contains multiple processes working together to provide the full Consensus Validator functionality.
{% endhint %}

These processes are the following:

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aesm_service`          | Provides EPID provisioning for the enclave.              |
| `filebeat`              | Provides logging.                                        |
| `mc-ledger-migration`   | Performs the ledger migration, if necessary, then stops. |
| `ledger-distribution`   | Distributes the ledger to S3 archiv&#x65;**.**           |
| `mc-admin-http-gateway` | Provides the admin panel to the Consensus Service.       |
