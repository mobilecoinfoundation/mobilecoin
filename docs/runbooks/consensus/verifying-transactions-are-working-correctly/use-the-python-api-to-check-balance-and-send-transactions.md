# Use the Python API to Check Balance and Send Transactions

**Step 1:** Start jupyter notebook.

`jupyter notebook`

**Step 2:** From jupyter, open up [mobilecoind/clients/python/jupyter/wallet.ipynb](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/mobilecoin/blob/master/mobilecoind/clients/python/jupyter/wallet.ipynb)

**Step 3:** Connect to the mobilecoind running locally.

**Step 4:** Replace the entropy with your entropy.

{% hint style="info" %}
You should receive entropy specific to TestNet that has already been populated with coins.

**Step 5:** Check balance.

**Step 6:** Generate a Request Code for your account.

**Step 7:** Replace the Request Code in the Send a Transaction Cell with your Request Code and send a transaction.

**Step 8:** Check balance once more to verify that your balance decreased by the minimum fee (10).
