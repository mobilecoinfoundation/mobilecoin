# About Common Tasks

This runbook is specifically for node operators who will be setting up and operating validator nodes on the MobileCoin network. Running a modified version of the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf), nodes running the consensus service agree on the content of the blockchain and publish the results. By using Intel's SGX secure enclaves, transactions remain private.

{% hint style="info" %}
The assumption is that you have a node and are ready to run the Consensus Service.
