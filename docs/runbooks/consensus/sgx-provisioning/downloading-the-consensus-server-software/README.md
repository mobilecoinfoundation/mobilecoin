# Downloading the Consensus Server Software

The MobileCoin Consensus Service facilitates transactions between MobileCoin users. The software needed to participate in the MobileCoin Consensus network can either be:

* Downloaded and run using a pre-built Docker container from the Docker Hub (preferred method).
* Built from source code.

{% hint style="info" %}
We prefer that you run the container over downloading the software on your own because we have developed the software with best practices in mind.
{% endhint %}
