# Uneven Node Block Heights

In the event that all nodes are not at the same block height during a rollback, and cannot “settle” to the same level, the call participants must decide whether to roll back the ledger to a predetermined point (e.g. the lowest common block) or allow nodes to “catch up” to the highest available block, or some point in between. If a ledger rollback is decided, all operators must be able to delete some of their S3-published ledger material. This must be accompanied by public announcement of the invalidity of certain blocks.
