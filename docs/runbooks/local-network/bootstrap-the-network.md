# Bootstrap the Network

The network will need some pre-generated block(s) and accounts.

Navigate to tools/local-network/ inside of the mobilecoin repo in the docker container and run

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

This will generate sample\_data, which includes a ledger db and account keys to use for testing
