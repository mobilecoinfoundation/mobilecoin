## MobileCoin Python Client for Use with `mobilecoind`

To send and receive transactions, you can use `mobilecoind`'s wallet bindings.

See the jupyter notebook at [Wallet.ipynb](./Wallet.ipynb) for a walk through of an example Python wallet client.


## Running the Blockchain Explorer

The `blockchain_explorer` directory contains a simple webserver for the blockchain content that mobilecoind downloads.

Run the included `start_webserver.sh` script to launch the server at http://localhost:5000
