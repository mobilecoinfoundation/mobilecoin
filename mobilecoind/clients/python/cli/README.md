## Python CLI tools for `mobilecoind`

### Getting your Public Address

Every 32-byte Master Key defines a unique MobileCoin account. You can share the corresponding public address with other users by sending them the base-58 encoded "Address Code" or the "Address URL" generated by this CLI tool. The "Address URL" can be conveniently embedded as the payload of a QR code.

Note that this command creates a monitor for the provided or generated Master Key that will remain active until removed.

Help:
```
usage: get_public_address.py [-h] [-k KEY] [-s [SUBADDRESS]]

Displays public address information for a provided master key, or for a random master key if no key is provided.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k KEY, --key KEY     account master key
  -s [SUBADDRESS], --subaddress [SUBADDRESS]
                        (optional) subaddress
```

Example:
```
mobilecoin@node1:~/mobilecoin/mobilecoind/clients/python/cli$ python3 get_public_address.py

    Master Key:       2a4976758b6d8d687ba6aea1e934d8b6511a264e6b979ed74c58534e7b575a5b

### Checking your Balance

Because the MobileCoin ledger is encrypted, you must process every transaction with your Master Key in order to check your balance. This CLI tool creates an account monitor, waits for it to process all blocks in the ledger, and then displays the total unspent balance controlled by the provided Master Key.

Note that this command creates a monitor for the provided Master Key that will remain active until removed.

Help:
```
usage: check_balance.py [-h] -k KEY [-s [SUBADDRESS]]
                        [--first-block [FIRST_BLOCK]]

Processes all downloaded blocks to display current balance information for a provided master key.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k KEY, --key KEY     account master key
  -s [SUBADDRESS], --subaddress [SUBADDRESS]
                        (optional) subaddress
  --first-block [FIRST_BLOCK]
                        (optional) first ledger block to scan

```

Example:
```
mobilecoin@node1:~/mobilecoin/mobilecoind/clients/python/cli$ python3 check_balance.py -k=<master key (64 hex characters)>

    Master Key:       <master key (64 hex characters)>
    Subaddress Index: 0
    Address Code:     7BeDc5jpZu72AuNavumc8qo8CRJijtQ7QJXyPo9dpnqULaPhe6GdaDNF7cjxkTrDfTcfMgWVgDzKzbvTTwp32KQ78qpx7bUnPYxAgy92caJ
    Address URL:
    Balance:          998401053000000000 pMOB
                      998.40 kMOB

```

                       [--sender-subaddress [SENDER_SUBADDRESS]]
                       [--recipient-subaddress [RECIPIENT_SUBADDRESS]]

### Cleaning up old monitors

The performance of `mobilecoind` can decrease if there are a large number of active monitors. This tool helps you find and remove monitors that you no longer need but have left running in the background.

Usage:
```

python3 cleanup_monitors.py

```

### Running `mobilecoind` Benchmarks

This CLI tool measures the performance of the ledger and monitor background synchronization processes and other `mobilecoind` operations that may vary with the performance of your hardware and network connection.

Usage:
```

python3 benchmark.py

```
