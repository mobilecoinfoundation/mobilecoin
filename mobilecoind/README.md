## mobilecoind

The MobileCoin Daemon, or `mobilecoind`, is a standalone executable which provides blockchain synchronization and wallet services.

It creates encrypted, attested connections to validator nodes who are participating in federated voting in order to get the current block height, block headers, and to submit transactions. These validator nodes are considered highly trusted due to their use of SGX, and they are used as a reliable source for block information as well as to validate and process the proposed transactions from `mobilecoind`.

To keep the blockchain in sync, `mobilecoind` downloads new blocks from cloud storage and checks with the validator nodes that the block headers are correct. If this succeeds, they are added to a local copy of the blockchain called the Ledger DB. This is done periodically and ensures the local copy of the blockchain is fresh enough to calculate balances and generate transactions.

Wallet Clients, such as a CLI, wanting to use wallet services can register their keys through the [API](./api/proto/mobilecoind_api.proto). In addition to keeping the blockchain in sync, the MobileCoin Daemon maintains a list of unspent transactions owned by any registered keys for fast lookup and spending, in a database called the MobileCoin Daemon DB.

### Getting Started

#### Setup

In order to sync the ledger from multiple sources, you will need to specify the validator nodes that you trust, as well as the location where they publish their externalized blocks (this is typically an S3 bucket).

We use URIs to specify peers, such as:

```
mc://node1.test.mobilecoin.com/
```

You will need to specify a ledger location to which to sync the ledger. This directory can be empty (or non-existent), or can contain the origin block, created from [generate-sample-ledger](../util/generate-sample-ledger/README.md).
You will also need to specify a directory for the MobileCoin Daemon database, where keys and transaction data would be stored.

#### Verifying Block Signatures

When started with `--watcher-db`, mobilecoind syncs all block signatures from the consensus validator archives listed in the tx-source-urls. On sync, each block signature is verified. See the [watcher](../watcher/README.md) crate for more information.

#### Verifying Signed Enclaves

When mobilecoind connects to validator nodes, it verifies the integrity of their software using Intel's Secure Guard eXtensions (SGX) via attestation evidence.

The validator node provides a signed measurement of its internal state to assure that it is running exactly the software you expect. You must provide a specific file to mobilecoind on startup so that it has the materials it needs to validate the enclave's evidence.

The TestNet signature artifacts are available via

```
curl -O https://enclave-distribution.test.mobilecoin.com/production.json
```

This retrieves a json record of:

```json
{
    "enclave": "pool/<git revision>/<signing hash>/<filename>",
    "sigstruct": "pool/<git revision>/<signing hash>/<filename>",
}
```

The git revision refers to the TestNet release version, and provides the full path to the production version of the artifact.

For example, MobileCoin's TestNet enclave signature materials are available via:

```
curl -O https://enclave-distribution.test.mobilecoin.com/pool/bceca6256b2ad9a6ccc1b88c109687365677f0c9/bf7fa957a6a94acb588851bc8767eca5776c79f4fc2aa6bcb99312c3c386c/consensus-enclave.css
```

Once you fetch the sigstruct artifact, you must provide the sigstruct to mobilecoind via the environment variable `CONSENSUS_ENCLAVE_CSS=$(pwd)/consensus-enclave.css`.

#### Example Invocation

This invocation connects to two validator nodes in the MobileCoin demo network, uses their respective S3 buckets to download new blocks, polls every second for updates and provides a MobileCoinD API on port 4444.

>Note: The MobileCoin Daemon validates attestation evidence from the validator nodes, and so needs to know whether those validators are running with hardware SGX or in simulation mode, via the `SGX_MODE` variable. In addiiton it needs to know whether the enclave was built in debug or relase, via the `IAS_MODE` variable.

```
SGX_MODE=HW IAS_MODE=PROD CONSENSUS_ENCLAVE_CSS=$(pwd)/consensus-enclave.css \
    MC_LOG=debug,rustls=warn,hyper=warn,tokio_reactor=warn,mio=warn,want=warn,rusoto_core=error,h2=error,reqwest=error \
    cargo run --release -p mc-mobilecoind -- \
    --ledger-db /path/to/ledger \
    --watcher-db /path/to/watcher-db \

```

```cargo run --release -p mc-mobilecoind -- --help```
